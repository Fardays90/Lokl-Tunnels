# Lokl Tunnels

This project lets you expose local servers (e.g. `localhost:3000`) to the internet via a reverse proxy tunnel. Currently only supports http and https. It functions similarly to tools like **ngrok**, but is lightweight and requires no account creation. Made using **Go** and **WebSockets**
